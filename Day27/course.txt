Day27 : 

This week is a company week. I am an apprentice engineer in information systems. 
I am working at Enedis Paris. I have a position of developer. 
The technical stack is : Php, Laravel framework and we are hosting with Azure. 
My mission of the day was to add a user attribute from a library we added to the project. 
The library is: https://github.com/haruncpi/laravel-user-activity 

The particularity of this one is that it uses angularJs. 
I had to put my feet in it and it was not easy !

The project that we are developing in the company is to have a census of the electrical clearances,
for each agency in Paris and each department in the region. 
Local managers will then be able to use this management tool to facilitate their daily work.
