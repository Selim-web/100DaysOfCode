Day19 : 

Today, I coded for my school project and had time to do a lot of things.
First, I worked on the continuous integration of the project. 
I added a pipeline on Jenkins in order to scan our gitlab server and deploy continuously in our integration server. 
Our server is an Ubuntu 18.04 virtual machine. 

Then, I coded on the front end using javaScript to have dynamic content. 
Then I did a refactoring at the git level.
Finally, I started to think about an algorithm related to the energy consumption of my equipment.
