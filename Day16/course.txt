Day 16 : 

Today I realized that I had not pushed my work day yesterday, I am contracted. 
Yesterday I worked on the automation of an equipment related to my school project. 
I started to write an algorithm and used Scheduling annotation in Spring Boot.
It is for check the outside temperature every minute. 
If it changes, then all the equipment that is in automatic mode will have an updated temperature. 

The method is written this way in Java: 

 @Scheduled(fixedRate = 60000) // refresh
public void CheckOutdoorTemp() {
        Integer temp_exterieur = heatingDwpRepo.getScenario(); // recovery of the temperature in database
        heatingDwpRepo.updateTemperature(temp_exterieur); // update the temperature 
    }
