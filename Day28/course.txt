Day28 : 

Today in the company, we didn't have any new features to develop so we did some code review and comments in the custom classes.

Having had some free time, I advanced on the backend of my school project. 
I have started the consumption part of my scope since Day26. 
I have since revised the function that checks if an employee has made a reservation by making the date evolve faster for testing. 

Then once I got the list of rooms where to evolve the consumption in relation to the employee_id, 
I started to think about how to add consumption according to the type of equipment.
