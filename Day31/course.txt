Day30 : 

Between yesterday and today, I started the front end in relation to the backend functions built in relation to consumption. 
I coded the proxy, the service and the controller in question and then I used ChartJS to make a graph. 
I was confronted with a problem that I would get a list of maps, but to make my chart with ChartJS I needed only one map. 
I then converted the list to a map in the backend and it worked fine.

The second problem I had was that the values were not in order. 
I changed my map to linkedhashmap in order to have the values in order in the query output. 

Now that the display of data between the frontend and the backend is going well, I will be able to do more testing and see if the graphs evolve accordingly. 

You can find the HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT code in the project.java file and JAVA code in project.java
