Day20 : 

Today I coded on my school project with my group. 
Our goal during this iteration is to use mocks to insert data in the base. 
The idea is to create an external application in order to be able to execute mocks. They will populate our database. 
I used Spring Boot and created a mini backend with a UserMock class that implements the InitializingBean interface.
In order to have attributes in a random way and rather in adequacy, I used the Java Faker library
