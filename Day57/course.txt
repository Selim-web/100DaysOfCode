Day57 : 

A lot has been done in 15 days. I kept this habit of coding every day except for 4 days. 
I have family who came to my house and I went abroad for 3 days.

I made progress on the data mock by fixing some issues with the timestamp evolution of Day43. 

I redesigned the dashboard to make it more ergonomic. 

I improved my backend by modifying the user's consumption retrieval. 
Our product owner asked us to insert the consumption every X minutes in order to have a history. 

This week I'm at work and I'm still working on parallax scrolling with a zoom on an element during a scroll.
