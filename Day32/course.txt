Day32 : 

Today I didn't do much coding, I did a lot of testing with what was set up on the front end. 
I noticed that as I use a map, if I consume on the same date in two different rooms, only one value is displayed because the key can't be duplicated. To fix this, 
I'm going to sum the two energies or differentiate the consumption according to the employee_id and the room_id 

I've also thought about redesigning the front end to include the consumption graph.
