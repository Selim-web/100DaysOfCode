# 100DaysOfCode

 Beginning of challenge 100DaysOfCode. I want a create a habit to code every day. This will help me to build momentum in some topics. The projects that I’ll build will be small in scope, so by the time I finish, I’ll have completed several of them — and gained a wide range of experience.
