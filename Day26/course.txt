Day26 : 

Today, I worked on the consumption part of my scope. 
I have to monitor the use of the equipment in each room according to the employee who uses the equipment. 

I thought about an algorithm that I split into several methods. To add real time consumption, 
I wrote a method with a SQL query that allows me to know: if an employee has a current reservation in a booking table. 

requete SQL : "select 1 from booking where start_time <= ?2 and end_time >= ?2 and id_person=?1"

It takes as parameter a given date and the id of an employee. There will be a schedule that will browse a list. 
To get results quickly, a date will be given and will evolve during the schedule. Otherwise a now() would have been enough to make real time. 

Working with dates in java is not that simple!

For the moment the code to check is : 

public void AddConsumption() {
        Iterable<Employee> employeeList = employeeRepo.findAll();
        //System.out.println(employeeList);
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2022,01,05);
        System.out.println(date+"T21:00:00");
        String valueTime = date+"T21:10:00";
        LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.parse(valueTime);
        for (Employee employe: employeeList) {
            System.out.println(dateTime);
           System.out.println(consumptionDwpRepo.checkIfEmployeHaveBooked(employe.getIdEmployee(),dateTime)); // I need to add : if result of this condition is == 1, add Consumption in Room_id = ? with id_person = ?
        }

    }
