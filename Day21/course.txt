Day21 : 

In this day I work on my backend school project. 
My scope related to my school project is to use equipment via the app.
Our product owner asked me to automate the use of the equipment. 
I worked on the automation of the heating by taking into account the indoor and outdoor temperature.
I took back the algorithm done during the day18. 
I had to take into account in the database a table named scenario which will be fed by mocks.

the code : project.java
